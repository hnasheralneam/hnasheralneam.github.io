         <h2 id="about-me">About me</h2>
         <p>I'm a high school student in the United States. When I have time, I like to do programming, which has been mostly full stack web dev. Now, I'm trying out a different languages and tools. Fedora KDE btw.</p>
         <br>
         <h2 id="work">Work</h2>
         <p>As mentioned above, I've been just experimenting around recently, working on a bunch of small projects in Python, GDscript, Java, and Kotlin, until I find something good enough to stick with. If you want to see whatever project I'm working on this week, it'll be up on my <a href="https://github.com/hnasheralneam">GitHub</a>. Right now, I'm working on a bunch of cool projects for  <a href="https://hackclub.com/arcade/">Hack Club Arcade</a></p>
         <p>Recently, I've been working on setting up a server, an old desktop from around 2010. It's running Opensuse Tumbleweed, because I decided a rolling release is a good choice for a server. Now I'm trying to self-host everything, from photo backup with Immich to file backup with Rysnc, along with a shelf-hosted Gitea instance. The website is on is <a href="http://hnasheralneam.onthewifi.com">hnasheralneam.onthewifi.com</a>, but the server is off right now and I probably won't remember to update this when it's on again </p>
         <h3>Other work</h3>
         <p>Another small tool I made is <a href="activity-log/">Activity Log</a>, which is meant to be used for tracking time. It's a cool project, with decent design and charts and everything. I'm trying to make it an Android app.</p>
         <p>Recently, a <a href="https://github.com/Urdons/">friend</a> and I made a developer profile tool for a hackathon project; <a href="https://codefetch.onrender.com">here it is</a>. Right now it only fetches data from GitHub.</p>
         <br>
         <h2 id="workflow">Tools</h2>
         <p>Languages: JavaScript, Python</p>
         <p>Code editors: Zed, VS Code</p>
         <p>Frameworks and tools: Tailwind CSS, some Typescript, NodeJS</p>
         <h3>Software</h3>
         <p>Firefox, Linux, KDE</p>
         <p>Keyboard layouts are programmer's dvorak (~100wpm) and arabic 101 (~15wpm).</p>
         <h3>Opinions</h3>
         <p>I use Python, sometimes, when I can't avoid it.</p>
         <p>The type checking in Java is actually really nice.</p>
         <p>I ❤️ open source</p>
